🎬 Movie Recommender System

A machine learning-based Movie Recommendation System that uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and clustering techniques to suggest similar movies to users based on their preferences or selected titles.


🚀 Features


📌 Content-based Filtering using KNN

🧠 Clustering of similar movies using KMeans

🎯 Personalized movie recommendations

📊 Based on genres, ratings, popularity, and other metadata

🧹 Clean and scalable code structure for further improvements


🛠 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (KNeighborsClassifier, KMeans)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional: for visualizations)
Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (if there's a UI)


📁 Dataset

You can use any of the following:

TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset

MovieLens Dataset

Make sure the dataset includes features like:


Movie title

Genre

Keywords

Ratings

Popularity / Vote Count

🧠 How It Works

Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and extract relevant features.

Feature Vectorization: Use TF-IDF or CountVectorizer on text data (like genres and keywords).

Clustering: Group similar movies using KMeans (optional).

KNN Algorithm: For a given movie, find its top-N nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Recommendation: Return the most similar movies.
